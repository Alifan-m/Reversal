# Reverse Number Range

## Description
This Python script requests two numbers from the user and prints all the numbers in between them in reverse order. It ensures that the numbers are printed from the larger to the smaller value, making the output always in descending order.

## How It Works
1. The script prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. It determines the range of numbers between the two inputs.
3. The numbers are printed in reverse order (from highest to lowest).

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Input two numbers when prompted.
3. View the output displaying the numbers in between, printed in descending order.
